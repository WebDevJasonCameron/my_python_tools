The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.
Six Buttons.You can press one of the rodnulls six buttons as a bonus action. A buttonnulls effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.
If you pressbutton 1, the rod becomes aflame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rodnulls flanged head (you choose the type of sword).
If you pressbutton 2, the rodnulls flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
If you pressbutton 3, the rodnulls flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rodnulls tip, and the rodnulls handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
If you pressbutton 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.
If you pressbutton 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
If you pressbutton 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.
Drain Life.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property cannullt be used again until the next dawn.

* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards
Balance.Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.
Comet.If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.
Donjon.You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You cannullt be located by any divination magic, but awishspell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.
Euryale.The cardnulls medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.
The Fates.Realitynulls fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the cardnulls magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.
Flames.A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
Fool.You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.
Gem.Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.
Idiot.Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.
Jester.You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.
Key.A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.
Knight.You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.
Moon.You are granted the ability to cast thewish spell 1d3 times.
Rogue.A nonplayer character of the GMnulls choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isnnullt known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wishspell or divine intervention can end the NPCnulls hostility toward you.
Ruin.All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.
Skull.You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GMnulls choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death cannullt be restored to life.

Throne.You gain proficiency in the[Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion)skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.
Vizier.At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.
The Void.This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GMnulls choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is[incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated). Awishspell cannullt restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.
Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become[charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed)by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.
While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb castssuggestionon you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.
#### Random Properties
AnOrb of Dragonkindhas the following random properties:
-   2 minor beneficial properties
-   1 minor detrimental property
-   1 major detrimental property
#### Spells
The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:cure wounds(5th-level version, 3 charges),daylight(1 charge),death ward(2 charges), orscrying(3 charges).
You can also use an action to cast thedetect magicspell from the orb without using any charges.
#### Call Dragons
While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
