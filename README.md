# My Python Tools

This repo consists of python scripts I build to convert files from PDFs, Notion CSV files, or other such files, into markdown (md) files. I probably use most of the converted md files in one of my obsidian vaults. As such, this repo will probably remain very randomized in it's utility. If you want, feel free to look through and use scripts I've come up for ideas on how you too can convert large amounts of data into a something more functional.
